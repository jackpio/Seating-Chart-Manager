This is a project that I made during my senior year of high school. It was a year long project. I chose the idea, designed it completely, and completed all of the Java code. 
This application allowed for teachers to input their seating charts. Teachers could manage their classrooms and COVID statuses. 
A student could be marked covid-positive. This would add the student to the COVID list on the right side of the GUI.
It would collect metrics like the total number of students in the class, COVID case count, and % of the class out with COVID.
